HOW TO IMPORT LIBRARY

1. Import libVTiOSAPI.a
   - Download our latest release libVTiOSAPI.a from our github (https://github.com/veritrans/vt-iOSlib-SampleStore/releases)
   - Create a folder named ‘lib’ under your root project folder (this is optional, you can always name your folder for something else)
   - Copy libVTiOSAPI.a to previously created ‘lib’ folder
   - Click your project from ‘Project Structure’ in XCode
   - Choose ‘Build Phases’
   - Under ‘Link Binary with Libraries’ click the ‘+’ symbol and choose ‘add other’
   - Browse to previously created ‘lib’ folder and choose libVTiOSAPI.a. Then XCode will add it under your tree project
2. Create Bridging-Header file
   - Copy ‘include’ folder from our release to your root project folder
   - Drag your ‘include’ folder from finder into your XCode Project Structure
   - Click on ‘Project Structure’ and choose ‘Build Settings’ tab
   - Search for ‘Objective-C Bridging Header’ under ‘Swift Compiler - Code Generation’
   - Double click on input on the right side, and put ‘$SOURCE_ROOT/include/VTiOSAPI-Bridging-Header.h‘ (make sure ‘include’ folder is inside your root project’)
   - Now you can use VTiOSAPI in your project.
